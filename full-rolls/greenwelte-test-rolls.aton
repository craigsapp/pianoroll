@NOTES:	
	This roll plays each of the 88 notes of the key-board from lowest to
	highest.  Has the number "25326" stamped at the end of the roll.
	Leader has the following text, dated 1-7-1967:
	<i>This is test number eleven from a Welte-Mignon 98er test roll.  
	It is the second half (and the last part) of the original roll.  
	It may be used as a repitition [sic] test for all player-pianos
	taking rolls 11-1/4" wide at a scale of nine ports to the inch 
	according to the Buffalo Convention of 1911.  The re-roll port at
	the end will operate Welte 98ers and Aeolian players.</i>
@PHYSICAL_NOTES: Left flange rim is 25% missing. Notice the numerous
		tears on both edges of the roll.  In this case they are not
		a problem since they do not cover or remove any note holes.
@SCAN_NOTES: The aberration at the end of the roll is due to not
	stopping the scanning while re-winding the roll.
