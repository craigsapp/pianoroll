	TO INSURE PERFECT TRACKING OF MUSIC ROLLS.
	See that music roll is loosely wound on spool, then hold in the 
	hand with the slotted end down.  Let roll drop lightly two or three times
	into the palm of the other hand, thus throwing the entire music sheet against
	the right flange of spool.  Tighten roll in the usual manner and it is 
	ready to play.
