Ludwig van Beethoven, Sonata Op. 13 (Path√©tique) 1st movement Duo-Art 5691

Roll in excellent condition, except for leader which needed minor
repairs to prevent irregular tempo during play. Roll has several
inkspots (or similar), which an optical scan would identify as
notes.

The small difference in playing time of the two files is due to a
slight correction of the roll tempo. Also, playing time is affected
by how the paper winds on the take-up spool. It is typical to have
a few seconds difference between recordings of the same roll.

Suspect this roll is a later cut than 1915, due to type of paper.
Roll 5696 (Saint-Saens) appears to be an earlier cut, perhaps from
1915.
