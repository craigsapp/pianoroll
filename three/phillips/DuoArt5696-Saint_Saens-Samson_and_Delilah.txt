Samson and Delilah roll Duo-Art 5696

While a perfect looking roll, it has three errors. I have noted
this on the roll (in pencil) as Note 1 and 2. In the MIDI file, at
bar 63, note E4 is broken. This is incorrect and is due to the way
the roll has been punched. Similarly, at bar 66, notes A4 and B4
are broken, due to the same problem. I have inserted flags at these
two points in the MIDI file titled Samson et Delilah, St-Saens,
5696, for CS-1.mid. These are viewable in Cakewalk.

This problem did not occur with the Condon roll which also had a
different tempo marking of 80. Yours is marked 90.

This illustrates the variables with rolls! I have encountered similar
issues many times. Surprisingly, the roll with a tempo of 80 has a
playing time of 5:00, where your roll marked tempo 90 has a longer
playing time of 5:13. I suspect your roll is an early cut, and a
new master was produced for later production rolls.
