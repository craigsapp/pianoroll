		Text in sample:
		<br><br>
		24. A portion of Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C minor, played by Buhlig.
		This test is made to ascertain whether or not quickly repeated notes
		will play on light pressure.  If these repeated notes do not just
		barely speak, you have made an error in setting the dynamics in the 
		first test, and it will be necessary for you to slightly
		increase the tone values at the very start.
