@DESCRIPTION:	Bass chord test.
@COMMENTARY:	
	Text for this test:
	6. 1, 2, 3 and 4 note test for the bass section of the piano.
	The single note will speak quite clearly, the chords of two
	notes a little softer, the chords of three still
	softer and the chords of four should just [barely]
	speak.  This test is to check up the previous work, as
	shown by the tests Nos. 4 and 5.
