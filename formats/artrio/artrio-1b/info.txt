	The same notes being played with the Melodant perforations operating.
	These notes should be played slightly louder than the preceding.  However,
	the increase of dynamics should be very slight and just noticeable.  If the
	degree of change between four and five is not satisfactory, the spring on
	the center control should be tightened or loosened as required.

	6. 1, 2, 3 and 4 note test for the bass section of the piano.
	The single note will speak quite clearly, the chords of two
	notes a little softer, the chords of three still
	softer and the chords of four should just [barely]
	speak.  This test is to check up the previous work, as
	shown by the tests Nos. 4 and 5.

@COMMENTARY:	
	Text for this sample:
	<br><br>
	8. Bass and treble chords striking alternately to ascertain whether or
	not the bass and treble are properly balanced.  If the bass and treble does
	not balance correctly, the adjustment can be made by changing the position
	of either the bass or treble control springs as tests may show necessary.
	<br><br>
	9. Bass and treble balance test with one-dot Melodant.  This one-dot Melodant
	should raise the tone just a very little.  If it is too strong, the spring
	on the center control should be let out.
	<br><br>
	10. The same test with the double dot Melodant.  This should raise the tone
	just a shade stringer than with the single dot perforation.

	11. The same test as No. 10, but with the soft pedal perforations which will either
	move the keys in a Grand piano or operate the hammer rail in an Upright piano.
	With this perforation the tone should be slightly software than as shown in No. 10 test.
	<br><br>
	12. The same as No. 11 except that the Melodant perforation is off.  This
	should produce the very softest possible effects.
	<br><br>
	13. Bass and treble chords struck simultaneously without any marginal
	perforations.  These notes should just barely speak.

	19. Three chords struck with treble Melodant and center controls H, J, K, M
	open respectively.  All four of these controls should have the same dynamic
	force (a slightly step above the three chords struck with Melodant only
	in test No. 18.).
