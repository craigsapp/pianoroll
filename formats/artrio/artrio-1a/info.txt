		The printed instructions preceding each test, explain just what
		each test is made for and what results should be obtained.
		<br><br>
		1. All marginal perforations, except re-roll, sustaining pedal
		and key shift, both bass and treble opened so that you may be
		able to ascertain whether or not the air passages are free
		and that the vents or bleeds are open.
		<br><br>
		2. The Chromatic scale repeat test.   Operate tempo at 50.
		Each note should play very softly and repeated quickly.  If you 
		wish to try repetition faster, set tempo at 80 and hold crescendo
		lever about half way open.

		4. First test for setting the dynamics.  Tempo 70.  The runs should play
		very softly, but every note should speak clearly.  To obtain proper
		results, adjust springs on bass and treble chokers as required.
		If strengthening the bass or treble choker springs does not
		increase the tone, the spring on the center control should be stiffened.
