@CALLNUM:	Condon Roll 424
@NOTE:		Lined paper. Very early print (ca. 1907). "Zum Tanz gespielt"

@COMMENTARY:    This roll has 102 inked lines printed lengthwise along the
		roll.  The outer pair of lines are not associated with
		tracker holes (probably since they are too close
		to the borders of the paper.)  Red rolls have 100
		possible slots, and each slot is positioned on the center
		of each printed line.  The images below are oriented
		upside-down with respect to red-roll placement, so
		the high pitches are on the left.  (Red rolls are
		red upwards, while most other roll types are red
		downwards, hence the reversal in the scans, since all
		are scanned in the same orientation).
		<br><br>

		Here is the assignment of the 100 hole rows for Welte T-100
		red rolls.
		The first hole is the second line on the right (skipping 
		the border line) and then progresses to hole 100 which 
		is the penultimate line on the left (or in the opposite
		directions when the roll is oriented for performance).

		Some red rolls may have holes at positions 0 and 101, but their
		purpose is unknown and are not intended to be read on standard
		T-100 tracker bars.  The roll width is 12.902 inches (327.71 mm)
		and the hole spacing is 0.12526 inches (3.1816 mm) or approximately
		0.125 (8 holes to the international inch which is 25.4 mm).
		

@@BEGIN:	SAMPLE
@NUMBER:	01
@DESCRIPTION:	Start of the roll.  Two manual corrections on left side of roll.
		Shows asynchronous hole cutting.  Lined paper, with slots aligned to lines.
@COMMENTARY:	The lowest hole on the left is in Row 99 which turns on 
		treble mezzo forte expression.  The next hole up is in row 97
		for treble crescendo forte.  The first expression hole on the right
		is in row 2 for bass mezzo-forte on, followed by a hole in row 4
		for bass crescendo forte.
		The treble expression on the left of the image has two edits
		where holes in row 91 (return) are taped over and 
		new holes are added in row 93 (sustain pedal on).
		<br><br>
		The first note in the music which has a duration of 5 holes is
		in row 37 which represents pitch D3.  This agrees with
		this <a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncCO2sagdwM">YouTube video</a> 
		performance of the composition, and also agrees with 
		the <a target="_new" href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Frau_Luna_(Lincke,_Paul)">printed score</a> 
		(Act I, page 2, measure 6, LH).
		Note that the left and right hands are notated on the same beat
		in the score, but the LH note comes noticeably before the
		RH melody note in the roll (as well as 2nd and 3rd measure downbeats).

@DESCRIPTION:	About 10 feet in, showing editing: removing

@COMMENTARY:	The spacing between lines was measured to be 0.1256 inches (3.190 mm)
		and the paper 12.936 in (328.579 mm) based on measureing 7611 pixels
		between the outer two lines on the paper (and presuming that 600 dpi
		scanning resolution is exact).
