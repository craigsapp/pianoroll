@DESCRIPTION:	A few feet in.
@COMMENTARY:	Notice that the note durations are slightly
		different.  For example the hole on the red line
		alternate between being attached to each other
		and separated by a gap, typically smaller than
		the diameter of the holes.  The high sustained
		notes contain a sequence of evenly spaced
		holes.
